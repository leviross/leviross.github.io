<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>I grew up in a small Jewish community in Seattle and had an adventurous spirit at a young age. 
	That spirit brought me to the land of Israel where I spent a large portion of my adult life. I was so intrigued with the deep history and and colorful life of this ancient land. This background image is Tel Aviv beach which I am very fond of.</p>
<p>My outgoing personality was a natural fit for the sales industry which I have done for a long time.
I am now looking for a more challenging and exciting work environment that will give my family some real opportunities. I have so many good friends in the web development industry and I know I have what it takes to make this a real success!</p>
