	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>I will just focus on my main hobby which is playing guitar and jamming with friends. I have been playing acoustic and electric guitar since I was 17 and I wish I had more time. It is so fun to play music and get inspired. Music is very spiritual and allows me to express myself without using words which can be very limiting.</p>
